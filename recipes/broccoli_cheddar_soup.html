   <h3>So you're feeling lazy, maybe you just want to binge some of that newest Invincible (understandable) and you'd like a big bowl of cheesy goodness to go along with it. Look no further! This soup is an easy dinner that hits the spot and quick enough for a weeknight.</h3>
    <p>I know this Paneraâ€™s Broccoli Cheddar Soup recipe has made the rounds around the blogs but my job is to share recipes that I really love and this is one of them.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Luckily soup is fairly simple to make! I mean, it's all just in one pot, you know? Anyways here's the ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of chopped broccoli</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced carrots</li>
            <li>Sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Half & half</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Nutmeg (if you'd like ðŸ¤®)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>Yes, yes we're finally at the part where I tell you how to make this delicious goop:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the 1/4 cup butter and sautee the onions in it until soft. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture. Cook and stir over medium heat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the half & half and chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli and carrots. Cook over low heat for 20-25 minutes or until the broccoli and carrots are tender.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper. You can leave the soup chunky or blend about 1 cup of the soup and stir it in for a smoother soup (that's what I do). Return to low heat and add the cheese. If your heat is too high your soup can get grainy. Stir in the nutmeg if desired.</li>
        </ol>
