    <h3>Buenas Tardes! Ground Beef Tacos is one of our favorite weeknight family meals, especially on Taco Tuesdays!</h3>
    <p>I have a quick homemade taco seasoning that I love to use for this recipe so I can cook the taco meat in 10 minutes. Give it a try and itâ€™ll be your new go-to for taco night too!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Making taco seasoning from scratch is super easy and can be cheaper than buying the prepared taco seasoning. Nevertheless, here are the spices I include in my recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chili powder</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>Okay, it's Tuesday night, you got your taco ingredients, and you're itching to make some dang tacos!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hold your horses! Here are the steps to help complete and perfect your Tuesday night:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef with olive oil and then drain any fat.</li>
            <li>Add the spices along with the tomato paste and water (or tomato sauce)</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and then cook for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
        </ol>
