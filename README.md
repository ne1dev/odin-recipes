Pre-project:
Throughout this lesson I intend to use what I have learned about HTML to set up a pretty bare-bones website. 

I am unsure of the challenges ahead but here goes nothing!

(February 7 2024 aka post project) I faced one small challenge that turned into one massive challenge. In fact, it stopped me from completing this project way sooner. So when trying to link images I thought I had to download each image and upload it as my own. This cause a stir when they web browsers didn't want to load my own personal images. Because I don't know how to host my own server or anything like that I had no idea how to fix the issue. Honestly, all I had to do, especially for this project was to copy the image address and post that in place of the href (ðŸ˜­). Welp. It's done now. I made a mistake and I learned how to deal with it for the rest of forever (cool!)
